# Sometimes loaded packages will interfere with other ones.This can lead to some infuriating errors. I've noticed it with JSON packages
# (jsonlite and RJSONIO) and with dplyr and plyr. 

# Try these below if you are having issues that you suspect might be due to interfering packages

# detach a loaded package
detach(package:plyr)

# load function from specific package
RJSONIO::fromJSON
