# This could be quite useful, the function:
# "Writes an ASCII text representation of an R object to a file or connection, or uses one to recreate the object."

# Here's a silly example:

# create conditions for subsetting columns
sums<-as.data.frame(colSums(Master[,2:ncol(Master)], na.rm = T) > 10000)
sums<-subset(sums, sums[1]==T)
sums <- data.frame(names = row.names(sums), sums)
list<-list(sums$names)

## dput
dput(list)

## This gives you the code which can be passed into a linear model, or subset function for example... 
list<-c("colname1", "colname2", "colname3")

## Here's a better example using reshape:

DF_long = reshape(data = DF_wide,
              idvar = "Postcode",
              varying = dput(names(DF_wide[2:ncol(DF_wide)])),
              sep = "",
              timevar = "Wave",
              times = c(1,3,4,5,6,7),
              direction = "long")
